Just a personal repository for configs. The me_logo.png is property the
University of Minnesota, it is simply in this repo for ease of use. Everything
else here is released under the ISC license, which can be found in the LICENSE
file, or in the header of the files themselves. install-shell-extensions.sh is
for GNOME 3 on OpenBSD, since the gnome shell extensions addon for Firefox/
Chrome doesn't work correctly.
